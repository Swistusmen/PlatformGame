# PlatformGame
Libraries: SFML

Program is a simple game where you can move using a,d and space. There is only a player and the ground. I've implemented gra-
-vitaion and collision detction between the earth and the player. 

Program was created to learn basics in the gamedev, i didn't know architecture, program atterns and how-to-it before, and also
had no a teacher so thats why this program is so simply. It's a scratch, currently im implementing the same Game but in more
flexible, ordered and considered way.

I've also learned to make pet projecst basing on the text document in which i describe the etaps of work- something like spring backlog
